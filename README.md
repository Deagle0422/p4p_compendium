# üìÅ Folder Structure

### üîπ Source Code
The **`source_code`** directory contains two main subcomponents:

1. **Python Simulator (`Py-Simulator/`)**  
   Implements the full digital-twin production line with reinforcement learning and rule-based scheduling.  
   It simulates dynamic device status, queue balancing, and fault recovery mechanisms.

2. **SystemJ Exemplar Factory (`SystemJ-Factory/`)**  
   This component serves as a **prototype of a distributed control system** modeled in **SystemJ**, a synchronous reactive language designed for real-time embedded and cyber-physical systems.
   #### üéØ Purpose
    The exemplar factory demonstrates how a *reactive control layer* could manage physical or simulated devices (e.g., fillers, cappers, labelers) using synchronous signals and deterministic scheduling. It provides a conceptual and experimental base for future integration with the Python-based digital twin.
   #### üß© Current Implementation
    At the current stage, the SystemJ factory:
    - Includes several **control components (CDs)** representing factory workstations and communication channels.
    - Demonstrates **factory workflow progression**, such as bottle movement, workstation activation, and timing signals.
    - Can be executed via:
     ```bash
        ./gradlew run

### üîπ Project Files
The **`project_files`** folder contains design records, progress updates, and communication materials exchanged with the supervisor (Dr. Zoran Salcic).
These files document project evolution and architecture decisions.

### üîπ Results
The **`results`** folder stores simulation outputs and evaluation data from the Python simulator.
These include performance comparisons (RL vs Rule-based) data and visualized graphs of completion time, utilization, and load balance.

# Py-Simulator ‚Äî Digital Twin‚ÄìDriven Factory Simulation

This folder contains the Python-based simulation framework that models and evaluates a **digital-twin production line** for intelligent scheduling, fault recovery, and reinforcement learning (RL).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Design

### **Digital Twin Production Model**
Each physical factory component (fillers, cappers, labelers, conveyors) is modeled as a digital twin with:
- Realistic operational timing (`filler_time`, `cap_time`, `label_time`)
- Fault and recovery mechanisms
- Queue-based workpiece (bottle) flow
- Status tracking (`Working`, `Idle`, `Fault`, `Unavailable`)

These are implemented as `Device`, `Conveyor`, `BufferNode`, and `Bottle` classes.

- **Release interval** ‚Äî how fast new bottles are introduced.
- **Assignment strategy** ‚Äî whether to balance load or select the shortest queue.
- **Fault response** ‚Äî pause, emergency reroute, or conservative processing.
- **Recovery priority** ‚Äî which fault to repair first.

#### Main Components:
- `RLState`: Converts the entire production line into a high-dimensional numerical state vector (including queue lengths, fault ratios, utilization, etc.).
- `RLActionSpace`: Defines all discrete action combinations.
- `DQNAgent`: Implements a fault-aware deep Q-learning agent with replay buffers and adaptive exploration.
- `ProductionLineRL`: Connects the agent with the simulated environment.

---

### 3. **Simulation and Testing Framework**
- `normal_test.py` automate experiments by:
- Scaling production orders (10‚Äì10,000 bottles)
- Comparing RL vs non-RL (rule-based) performance

- `fault_test.py` automate experiments by:
- Injecting random filler faults (up to 50% per type)
- Comparing RL vs non-RL (rule-based) performance

#### Metrics:
| Metric | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `actual_completion_time` | Total time to complete all bottles |
| `avg_time` | Mean production time per bottle |
| `avg_utilization` | Average utilization rate of filler devices |
| `balance_degree` | Load balance across all fillers |

Results are visualized and stored in temporary directories created during execution.
